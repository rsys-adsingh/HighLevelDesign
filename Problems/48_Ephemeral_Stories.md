# 48. Design a Status Update Service with Ephemeral Content (Stories)

---

## 1. Functional Requirements (FR)

- **Post stories**: Upload photo/video stories that auto-delete after 24 hours
- **View stories**: Users see stories from people they follow in a tray/carousel at the top
- **Story ring**: Colored ring indicator shows unviewed stories
- **View tracking**: Track who viewed your story; show viewer list to author
- **Story reactions**: Reply to a story (sends a DM) or react with emoji
- **Close friends**: Post stories visible only to a selected "close friends" list
- **Highlights**: Pin select stories to profile permanently (opt out of deletion)
- **Story ordering**: Show stories from closest friends first, then by recency

---

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Low Latency**: Story tray loads in < 300 ms; story content in < 500 ms
- **Auto-Deletion**: Stories MUST disappear after exactly 24 hours (hard TTL)
- **High Throughput**: 500M+ stories/day, 10B+ story views/day
- **Availability**: 99.99%
- **CDN**: Media served from edge; < 100 ms first byte
- **Consistency**: View tracking must be accurate (no missed views)

---

## 3. Capacity Estimations

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| DAU | 500M |
| Stories posted / day | 500M |
| Story views / day | 10B |
| Avg story media size | 2 MB |
| Upload storage / day | 500M × 2 MB = 1 PB (but deleted after 24h!) |
| Peak concurrent story views / sec | 200K |
| Unique viewers per story (avg) | 50 |
| Storage steady state (24h window) | ~1 PB |

## 4. High-Level Design (HLD)

### Component Deep Dive

#### 24-Hour Auto-Deletion — The Key Challenge

```
Stories MUST disappear after exactly 24 hours. Zero tolerance.

Approach 1: Background deletion job (cron)
  Every minute: DELETE FROM stories WHERE expires_at < NOW()
  ✗ Up to 60-second delay after expiry
  ✗ At 500M stories/day → scanning is expensive
  ✗ Media files in S3 need separate cleanup

Approach 2: TTL-based deletion ⭐ (recommended)
  Cassandra: INSERT ... USING TTL 86400 (24 hours)
    → Cassandra automatically deletes the row after TTL expires
    → Zero application-level cleanup needed
  
  S3: Lifecycle policy on the bucket
    → Objects in /stories/ prefix expire after 24 hours
    → S3 handles deletion automatically
  
  Redis: EXPIRE key 86400
    → All story-related keys auto-expire
  
  Result: Three layers of automatic cleanup, no cron jobs needed.
  
  Edge case: "Highlights" — user pins a story to their profile
    → Copy story metadata + media to a permanent table/bucket
    → Original story still expires; highlight copy is permanent
```

#### View Tracking — High-Volume Writes

```
Every time a user views a story → write a view record:
  {viewer_id, story_id, viewed_at}

At 10B views/day = ~115K writes/sec → needs high write throughput

Cassandra table:
  CREATE TABLE story_viewers (
      story_id    UUID,
      viewer_id   UUID,
      viewed_at   TIMESTAMP,
      PRIMARY KEY (story_id, viewer_id)  -- dedup: one view per user
  ) WITH default_time_to_live = 86400;   -- auto-delete after 24h

Redis for fast check (has user viewed this story?):
  SADD story_viewed:{viewer_id}:{author_id} {story_id}
  EXPIRE story_viewed:{viewer_id}:{author_id} 86400

View count per story:
  INCR story_views:{story_id}
  EXPIRE story_views:{story_id} 86400
```

## 5. APIs

### Post Story
```http
POST /api/v1/stories
{ "media_url": "s3://...", "audience": "everyone" | "close_friends",
  "stickers": [...], "mentions": ["@alice"] }
→ 201 Created { "story_id": "s-uuid", "expires_at": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z" }
```

### Get Story Tray
```http
GET /api/v1/stories/tray
→ 200 OK
{ "tray": [
    { "user_id": "u-alice", "username": "alice", "avatar": "...",
      "has_unviewed": true, "story_count": 3, "latest_at": "..." },
    ...
]}
```

### View Story (Record + Fetch Content)
```http
GET /api/v1/stories/{story_id}
→ 200 OK { "story_id": "...", "media_url": "https://cdn.../...",
           "posted_at": "...", "view_count": 342 }
// Also records view event server-side
```

### Get Story Viewers (Author Only)
```http
GET /api/v1/stories/{story_id}/viewers?cursor=0&limit=50
→ 200 OK { "viewers": [{"user_id": "...", "name": "...", "viewed_at": "..."}] }
```

---

## 6. Data Model

### Cassandra — Story Metadata + Viewers
```sql
CREATE TABLE stories (
    author_id   UUID,
    story_id    TIMEUUID,
    media_url   TEXT,
    media_type  TEXT,        -- image, video
    audience    TEXT,        -- everyone, close_friends
    posted_at   TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (author_id, story_id)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (story_id DESC)
  AND default_time_to_live = 86400;

CREATE TABLE story_viewers (
    story_id    UUID,
    viewer_id   UUID,
    viewed_at   TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (story_id, viewer_id)
) WITH default_time_to_live = 86400;
```

### Redis
```
active_stories              → SET of user_ids who have active stories
tray:{user_id}              → List of author_ids (cached story tray, TTL: 5 min)
story_viewed:{viewer}:{author} → SET of viewed story_ids (TTL: 24h)
story_views:{story_id}      → Integer (view count, TTL: 24h)
```

---

## 7. Fault Tolerance

| Concern | Solution |
|---|---|
| **Story not deleted after 24h** | Triple TTL: Cassandra TTL + S3 lifecycle + Redis EXPIRE |
| **View tracking loss** | Kafka buffer before Cassandra write; at-least-once delivery |
| **Media processing failure** | Retry 3×; if still failing → mark story as "processing_failed" |
| **Story tray staleness** | Cache TTL = 5 min; manual refresh on pull-to-refresh |
| **Close friends privacy leak** | Audience check at story-fetch time, not just at tray level |

### Race Conditions

#### Story Expires While User Is Viewing

```
User opens story tray at T=23:59:55 (story expires at T+0:00:00)
User starts viewing story at T=23:59:58
Story TTL expires at T=0:00:00 → Cassandra deletes row

If user taps "viewers list" at T=0:00:03 → story_id not found → 404!

Solution: Soft expiry window
  Display until: expires_at + 5 min (grace period for active viewers)
  TTL in Cassandra: 86400 + 300 (24h + 5 min)
  UI shows "Expired" badge during grace period
  API returns story content during grace period but hides from tray
```

#### Fan-Out for Story Tray Updates

```
Alice posts a story → need to update story trays for all her followers

Pull model (lazy) ⭐:
  Don't fan-out. On tray request, check each followed user.
  For 1000 followings: 1000 Redis SISMEMBER checks → ~5 ms with pipeline
  
Push model (eager):
  On story post → write to all followers' tray lists in Redis
  For a user with 1M followers → 1M Redis writes → expensive
  
Hybrid:
  Push for regular users (< 10K followers) → fast tray loads
  Pull for celebrities (> 10K followers) → avoid expensive fan-out
```

## 8. Deep Dive: Engineering Trade-offs

### Cassandra TTL vs Application-Level Deletion

```
Cassandra TTL ⭐:
  ✓ Zero application code for deletion
  ✓ Handles tombstone cleanup automatically (compaction)
  ✗ Tombstones accumulate → read performance degrades until compaction
  ✗ Cannot "undo" a TTL (must re-insert to keep)
  
  Tombstone issue: After 500M stories expire/day, Cassandra creates
  500M tombstones. Until compaction runs → range queries slow down.
  
  Mitigation: 
    - Time-Window Compaction Strategy (TWCS) ⭐
    - Each SSTable covers a time window (1 hour)
    - When entire window expires → drop entire SSTable (no tombstones!)
    - Perfect for TTL-heavy workloads like stories

Application-level deletion:
  ✓ Full control over when and how
  ✗ Must implement cron job, handle failures, maintain consistency
  ✗ More operational burden

For stories: Cassandra TTL + TWCS compaction is the best fit.
```

### Close Friends — Audience-Restricted Stories

```
"Close Friends" list: a user-curated list of ~50 people who see private stories.

Data model:
  Redis SET: close_friends:{uid} = {friend_id_1, friend_id_2, ...}
  MySQL backup: close_friends table (user_id, friend_id) for persistence

Story posting with audience = "close_friends":
  1. Story metadata includes: audience = "close_friends"
  2. On story tray request: for each followed user with active stories:
     a. Fetch story audience type
     b. If audience = "close_friends" → check: SISMEMBER close_friends:{author} {viewer}
     c. If viewer IS in close friends → show story with green ring (special indicator)
     d. If viewer is NOT → skip this story entirely (invisible)

Privacy guarantee:
  - The viewer NEVER knows they're NOT in someone's close friends
  - They simply don't see the story — no "you're not in their close friends" message
  - Close friends list is completely private to the author

Race condition: Author removes Bob from close friends WHILE Bob is viewing the story
  Solution: Permission check happens at story FETCH time, not display time
  If removed → next story tap will skip remaining close-friends-only stories from that author
  Already-viewed content: unavoidable (they already saw it before removal)
```

### Story Tray Ordering — Who Shows First?

```
User opens Instagram → story tray at top → which stories appear first?

Ranking algorithm:
  For each followed user with active stories:
    score = w1 × has_unviewed_stories      (binary: 1 if unviewed, 0 if all viewed)
          + w2 × interaction_score          (DMs, likes, profile visits with this user)
          + w3 × recency_of_latest_story    (more recent = higher)
          - w4 × stories_already_viewed_today (fatigue: shown too many already = lower)
          + w5 × is_close_friend            (boost for close friends)

  Result:
    Position 1-3: Unviewed stories from closest friends
    Position 4-10: Unviewed stories from other followed users
    Position 11+: Viewed stories (dimmed ring) sorted by interaction score

  Pre-computation:
    interaction_score: computed offline (Spark, daily) from DM frequency, 
    comment exchanges, profile visits → stored in Redis hash
    HSET interaction_scores:{uid} {other_uid} 0.85

  Caching:
    Story tray order cached: tray:{uid} = [author_ids_ordered] (TTL: 5 min)
    Invalidated when: user views a story, new story posted by followed user
```

### Story Analytics — Creator Insights

```
Creators see analytics on their stories:
  - Total views, unique viewers
  - Forward taps (skipped ahead), backward taps (rewatched)
  - Exits (swiped away during this story)
  - Reply count

Data collection:
  Client sends events via Kafka:
    {story_id, viewer_id, event: "view"|"forward_tap"|"back_tap"|"exit"|"reply"}
  
  Flink aggregation:
    Per story: COUNT(views), COUNT(DISTINCT viewer_id), 
              COUNT(forward_taps), COUNT(exits)
  
  Storage: Redis hash per story (TTL: 24h, same as story)
    HSET story_analytics:{story_id} views 1523 unique 1200 
         forward_taps 342 exits 89 replies 12

  Display on creator's story viewer list:
    "1,200 people viewed • 12 replies • 89 exits"
    
  Insight: High exit rate on a story → content was boring/irrelevant
  Insight: High back_tap rate → content was interesting enough to rewatch
```

### Story Replies — Bridging Stories and DMs

```
User viewing a story → types a reply → sends as a DM to the story author

Implementation:
  Reply is a regular DM message with metadata:
    { type: "story_reply", story_id: "s-uuid", text: "Love this view!",
      story_thumbnail_url: "https://cdn.../thumb.jpg" }
  
  The DM thread shows the story thumbnail + reply text
  After 24h when story expires: thumbnail still visible in DM (cached copy)
  
  Why not delete the reply when story expires?
    The reply is a DM — it's a conversation, not ephemeral
    Only the STORY is ephemeral, not the conversation about it
    
  Rate limiting: Max 20 story replies/hour (prevent spam replies to celebrities)
```
