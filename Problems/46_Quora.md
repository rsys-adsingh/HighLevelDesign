# 46. Design Quora (Q&A Platform)

---

## 1. Functional Requirements (FR)

- **Ask questions**: Users post questions (with topics/tags)
- **Answer questions**: Users write answers; multiple answers per question
- **Upvote/Downvote**: Vote on answers (and questions) to surface quality
- **Follow topics/questions**: Get notified when new answers are posted
- **Feed**: Personalized home feed of questions and answers from followed topics/users
- **Search**: Full-text search across questions and answers
- **Spaces** (communities): Topic-based groups with moderation
- **Request answers**: Request a specific user to answer a question
- **Editing**: Collaborative editing with revision history
- **Content moderation**: Detect spam, hate speech, low-quality content

---

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Low Latency**: Feed and search in < 500 ms
- **SEO Friendly**: Questions/answers are the core value — must be crawlable and indexable
- **Scalability**: 300M+ MAU, 500M+ questions
- **Quality Ranking**: Best answers surfaced at top (not just newest)
- **Availability**: 99.99%
- **Write Volume**: Moderate (10K answers/min) but read-heavy (1M reads/min)

### Component Deep Dive

#### Answer Ranking — Wilson Score vs Simple Vote Count

```
Simple upvote - downvote:
  Answer A: 100 up, 2 down → score = 98
  Answer B: 5 up, 0 down → score = 5
  A ranks higher. Seems correct.

But what about:
  Answer C: 1 up, 0 down → score = 1
  Answer D: 500 up, 400 down → score = 100
  D ranks higher, but it's controversial (44% downvote rate!)
  C has 100% approval but only 1 vote → low confidence

Wilson Score Interval ⭐ (Reddit's approach):
  Considers BOTH the ratio of upvotes AND the sample size.
  Low confidence (few votes) → lower bound of score is low → ranks lower
  High confidence (many votes, high upvote ratio) → ranks higher
  
  Formula (lower bound of 95% confidence interval):
  score = (p + z²/2n - z√(p(1-p)/n + z²/4n²)) / (1 + z²/n)
  where p = upvotes/total, n = total votes, z = 1.96 (95% CI)
  
  This naturally handles:
    New answers (low n → low score → needs to "prove itself")
    Controversial answers (low p → low score even with many votes)
    Universally liked answers (high p, high n → highest score)
```

#### Feed Generation — Hybrid Push/Pull

```
Sources for a user's feed:
  1. New answers to questions they follow
  2. New questions in topics they follow
  3. Activity from users they follow
  4. Trending/recommended content
  
For normal users (pull):
  On feed load → query for recent activity from followed entities
  Merge, rank, return top 50
  Cache in Redis: feed:{user_id} (TTL: 5 min)

For prolific authors (fan-out):
  When a popular author writes an answer:
  → Don't fan out to 10M followers (too expensive)
  → Instead: add to trending/recommended pool
  → Followers discover it via periodic feed refresh
```

## 5. APIs

### Ask Question
```http
POST /api/v1/questions
{ "title": "What is the best database for analytics?", 
  "details": "I'm comparing ClickHouse, BigQuery, and Redshift...",
  "topics": ["databases", "analytics", "data-engineering"] }
→ 201 Created { "question_id": "q-uuid", "url": "/q/what-is-the-best-database-for-analytics" }
```

### Post Answer
```http
POST /api/v1/questions/{question_id}/answers
{ "body": "I'd recommend ClickHouse for self-hosted and BigQuery for managed..." }
→ 201 Created { "answer_id": "a-uuid" }
```

### Vote
```http
POST /api/v1/votes
{ "target_type": "answer", "target_id": "a-uuid", "vote": "up" }
→ 200 OK { "upvotes": 153, "downvotes": 4 }
```

## 6. Data Model

### MySQL (Vitess) — Core Data
```sql
CREATE TABLE questions (
    question_id     BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    author_id       BIGINT NOT NULL,
    title           VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    body            TEXT,
    slug            VARCHAR(500) UNIQUE,     -- SEO-friendly URL
    view_count      INT DEFAULT 0,
    answer_count    INT DEFAULT 0,
    follow_count    INT DEFAULT 0,
    status          ENUM('open','closed','merged') DEFAULT 'open',
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at      TIMESTAMP,
    FULLTEXT INDEX idx_search (title, body),
    INDEX idx_author (author_id)
);

CREATE TABLE answers (
    answer_id       BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    question_id     BIGINT NOT NULL,
    author_id       BIGINT NOT NULL,
    body            TEXT NOT NULL,
    upvotes         INT DEFAULT 0,
    downvotes       INT DEFAULT 0,
    wilson_score    FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
    is_accepted     BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_question_score (question_id, wilson_score DESC),
    INDEX idx_author (author_id)
);

CREATE TABLE votes (
    user_id         BIGINT,
    target_type     ENUM('question','answer'),
    target_id       BIGINT,
    vote_type       ENUM('up','down'),
    created_at      TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, target_type, target_id)  -- one vote per user per target
);
```

### Redis
```
vote_count:{type}:{id}    → Hash {up: 153, down: 4}
answer_order:{question_id} → Sorted Set (score = wilson_score, member = answer_id)
feed:{user_id}            → List of content_ids (TTL: 5 min)
```

---

## 7. Fault Tolerance

| Concern | Solution |
|---|---|
| **Vote manipulation** | Rate limit + only count votes from accounts > 7 days old |
| **Duplicate votes** | PRIMARY KEY (user_id, target_type, target_id) prevents duplicates |
| **Search index lag** | Elasticsearch updated via CDC (Debezium); lag < 30 seconds |
| **SEO staleness** | CDN cache TTL = 5 min; instant purge on content update |
| **Answer quality** | ML spam classifier + community flagging + moderator review queue |

### Race Conditions

#### Vote Count vs Wilson Score Drift
```
Multiple users vote simultaneously:
  T=0: upvotes=100, downvotes=4
  Thread A: reads (100,4) → votes up → writes upvotes=101
  Thread B: reads (100,4) → votes up → writes upvotes=101 (LOST UPDATE!)

Solution: Atomic increment
  UPDATE answers SET upvotes = upvotes + 1 WHERE answer_id = ?;
  Then: async job recomputes wilson_score from (upvotes, downvotes)
  Wilson score recomputation batched every 30 seconds (not per vote)
```

## 8. Deep Dive: Engineering Trade-offs

### SEO: Server-Side Rendering vs Client-Side

```
CSR (Single Page App):
  Google crawler loads page → sees empty div → JavaScript runs → content appears
  ✗ Google may not execute JS properly → pages not indexed → zero SEO traffic
  
SSR ⭐ (Quora's approach):
  Server renders full HTML with question/answer content
  Crawler sees complete content → indexes properly → SEO traffic
  
  Implementation: Next.js / Nuxt.js → render on server → send HTML
  Cache: Full HTML cached at CDN edge (CloudFront) → TTL 5 min
  Dynamic content (vote counts): client-side hydration after page load
  
  Result: Quora gets 50%+ of traffic from Google → SSR is non-negotiable
```

### MySQL vs MongoDB for Q&A Data

```
MySQL ⭐ (Quora's actual choice):
  ✓ Relational: question → answers → votes (natural joins)
  ✓ Strong consistency for vote counts
  ✓ FULLTEXT index for basic search
  ✓ Vitess for horizontal sharding
  ✗ Schema changes require migrations

MongoDB:
  ✓ Flexible schema (answers can have varying metadata)
  ✓ Embed answers inside question document (one read)
  ✗ Embedded answers grow unbounded (16 MB document limit!)
  ✗ No joins → vote aggregation is application-level
  
For Q&A: MySQL wins. The data is inherently relational, 
consistency matters, and Vitess solves scaling.
```

### Answer-to-Answer (A2A) Request Routing

```
"Request Alice to answer this question" — how to match questions to experts?

Algorithm:
  1. Extract topic tags from the question (NLP / manual tags)
  2. Find users who are experts in those topics:
     - Wrote answers in that topic with high Wilson scores
     - Have "topic credentials" (self-declared + community endorsed)
     - Are currently active (last active < 7 days)
  3. Rank by: expertise_score × activity_recency × response_rate
  4. Show top 5 suggested experts to the questioner
  5. On request: send notification to the expert

Rate limiting: Max 3 A2A requests per question, 10 per day per user
Expert can decline (or ignore) without penalty

Implementation:
  topic_experts:{topic_id} → Sorted Set (score = expertise_score)
  Updated weekly: Spark job aggregates answer quality per topic per user
```

### Question Deduplication — "Has This Already Been Asked?"

```
User types: "What is the best programming language for beginners?"
Similar existing questions:
  "What programming language should beginners learn?"
  "Best first programming language to learn?"
  
Detection pipeline:
  1. On question submit: compute sentence embedding (BERT/sentence-transformers)
  2. ANN search against index of existing question embeddings (Faiss/Milvus)
  3. If top match has similarity > 0.85 → suggest: "Similar question already exists"
  4. User can: merge into existing question OR confirm theirs is distinct
  
If merged: new question redirects to existing → concentrates answers
  → Better than 50 identical questions with 1 answer each

Storage: question_embeddings table in Milvus (768-dim vectors, 500M entries)
  Search time: ~10ms for top-5 similar questions
```

### Content Quality and Moderation

```
Quality signals per answer:
  - Length: very short answers (< 50 chars) flagged as low-quality
  - Formatting: proper paragraphs, bullet points → higher quality score
  - References: contains links/citations → credibility boost
  - Author expertise: author's track record in this topic
  - Plagiarism check: compare against existing answers (SimHash)

Moderation pipeline:
  1. Automated: spam classifier (logistic regression on text features)
     → catches 95% of spam (link farms, promotional content)
  2. Community: users flag content → if 3+ flags → human review queue
  3. Topic-specific moderators: volunteer power users per topic
  4. Appeals: author can appeal removal → reviewed by different moderator
  
Collapse vs Delete:
  Low-quality but not rule-breaking → "collapsed" (hidden by default, expandable)
  Rule-violating (spam, hate) → deleted entirely
  This preserves free expression while maintaining quality
```

### Search Ranking — Finding Answers Across 500M Questions

```
User searches: "best database for analytics"

Pipeline:
  1. Elasticsearch query: match title + body with BM25 relevance
  2. Re-rank results using engagement signals:
     search_score = w1 × text_relevance (BM25)
                  + w2 × answer_quality (avg Wilson score of answers)
                  + w3 × view_count (popularity)
                  + w4 × recency (newer questions slightly boosted)
                  + w5 × follow_count (more followed = more relevant)
  3. Filter: exclude closed/merged/spam questions
  4. Return top 20 results with best-answer snippet

  Elasticsearch index per question:
    { title (boost 2×), body (boost 1×), topics (boost 1.5×),
      top_answer_text (boost 0.5×) }
  
  Index update: via CDC (Debezium) from MySQL → Kafka → ES consumer
  Lag: < 30 seconds for new questions to be searchable

  Autocomplete: As user types in search bar, show matching questions
    → Prefix query on Elasticsearch → return top 5 matches
    → Same autocomplete used for question dedup (suggest before posting)
```

### Spaces (Communities) — Topic-Based Groups

```
Spaces = user-created communities around topics (like subreddits for Q&A)

Data model:
  spaces table: (space_id, name, description, owner_id, member_count, rules)
  space_members: (space_id, user_id, role: admin|moderator|member)
  space_questions: (space_id, question_id) — many-to-many
  
Features:
  - Questions can be posted to a Space (shown in Space feed)
  - Space admins set posting rules (topic guidelines, quality bar)
  - Space-specific moderation (admins + moderators)
  - Space feed: questions from the Space, ranked by engagement + recency
  
Feed generation:
  User follows 10 Spaces → aggregate latest questions across all Spaces
  Ranking: same Wilson-score based quality ranking within each Space
  Cache: space_feed:{space_id} = [question_ids] (TTL: 5 min)
```

### Edit History and Collaborative Editing

```
Answers can be edited (like Wikipedia-lite)

Edit tracking:
  answer_revisions table: (answer_id, version, body, edited_by, edited_at, edit_summary)
  On edit: INSERT new revision, UPDATE current answer body, 
           notify followers: "Alice edited her answer to..."

  Show: "Edited 2 hours ago" with "View edit history" link
  Diff view: side-by-side comparison of two revisions (use diff algorithm)
  
  Permissions:
    Original author: can always edit their own answer
    Suggested edits: other users can SUGGEST edits → author approves/rejects
    This prevents vandalism while enabling collaborative improvement

Author credibility score:
  Computed per-topic:
    credibility = w1 × total_upvotes_in_topic
                + w2 × answer_count_in_topic
                + w3 × avg_wilson_score_in_topic
                + w4 × credentials_verified (e.g., "PhD in Computer Science")
  
  Displayed as: "Top Writer in Databases" badge
  Updated: weekly batch job (Spark aggregation)
  Used in: answer ranking, A2A suggestions, feed curation
