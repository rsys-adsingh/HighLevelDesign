# HLD Prep — 103 System Design Problems

> **For senior / staff engineers** who already know the fundamentals but need to sharpen depth, nail tricky trade-offs, and plug gaps that cost rounds.

The 102 problems are split into **three progressive batches**:

| Batch | Problems | Goal |
|-------|----|------|
| **🔴 Batch 1 — Must Do** | 31 | High ROI. Covers the widest spread of categories, each one chosen because it teaches a **non-obvious depth concept** that senior/staff interviews specifically probe. Completing just this batch gives you strong coverage across all major domains. |
| **🟡 Batch 2 — Expand** | 32 | Broadens your arsenal. Fills remaining categories, introduces niche domains (fintech, ad-tech, ML systems, CDC, workflow orchestration), and adds problems where the **differentiator is a specific technique** (CRDT, circuit breaker, consensus, durable execution). |
| **🟢 Batch 3 — Good to Have** | 40 | Lower marginal ROI. Either simpler problems you can reason through in an interview without deep prep, or very specialized systems. Study if time permits — these won't be your weak link. |

Within each batch, problems are ordered so that **earlier ones build foundations that later ones reference**.

## 🎯 How to Use This

1. **Start with Batch 1 in order** — each problem builds on concepts from earlier ones. If short on time, even the first 15 give you excellent coverage.

2. **For each problem, focus on:**
   - Requirements scoping (interviewers test if you ask the right clarifying questions)
   - Back-of-the-envelope math (don't skip this — staff rounds always probe it)
   - One or two **deep dives** — the "Key Concepts" column tells you exactly what the interviewer will zoom into
   - Trade-offs — never present one solution, always compare alternatives

3. **If you only have 2 weeks:** Batch 1 problems 1–15 + skim the rest of Batch 1.
4. **If you have 4 weeks:** All of Batch 1 + Batch 2 problems 1–15.
5. **If you have 6+ weeks:** Batch 1 + Batch 2 fully, cherry-pick from Batch 3.
